# Flutter using Golang for build cross platform Desktop Application


## Getting started

The best way to get started is to install [hover](https://github.com/go-flutter-desktop/hover), the official go-flutter tool to set up, build and run Flutter apps on the desktop, including hot-reload.

Read the [hover tutorial](https://github.com/go-flutter-desktop/hover) to run your app on the desktop, or start with [one of our example apps](https://github.com/go-flutter-desktop/examples).

If you want more in-depth information about go-flutter, read the [wiki](https://github.com/go-flutter-desktop/go-flutter/wiki).

## Version compatibility

### Flutter version

Flutter itself is a relatively young project. Its framework and engine are updated often. The go-flutter project tries to stay compatible with the [beta channel](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Flutter-build-release-channels) of Flutter.

### Go version

Updating Go is simple and Go [seldomly has backwards-incompatible changes](https://golang.org/doc/go1compat). This project remains compatible with the [latest Go stable release](https://golang.org/dl/).

### GLFW version

This project uses go-gl/glfw for GLFW v3.2.
